# Netris Make Targets and Options

This is the detailed input reference for `infra/netris/Makefile`. It describes
the Make variables, environment/configuration inputs, Ansible extra variables,
and which targets consume them. The root README remains the generic guide for
all backends; the [Netris README](README.md) gives the Netris workflow and
common options.

## Run from the right directory

For an end-to-end run, use the repository root. `INFRA` is required there. The
root pipeline runs `setup-infra` → `deploy-infra` → `deploy-ocp` →
`deploy-osac` → `prepare-suite` (which runs `setup-<DEPLOY_SUITE>`) →
`run-tests` (`test-<TEST_SUITE>`). `IMG` is the same in every command:

```bash
IMG='osac_branch=<branch> fulfillment_service_image=<reg>/fulfillment-service:<tag> osac_operator_image=<reg>/osac-operator:<tag> osac_aap_image=<reg>/osac-aap:<tag>'
make e2e INFRA=netris DEPLOY_SUITE=vmaas EXTRA_VARS="$IMG"                         # VMaaS networking
make e2e INFRA=netris DEPLOY_SUITE=bmaas EXTRA_VARS="$IMG"                         # BMaaS networking
make e2e INFRA=netris DEPLOY_SUITE=full TEST_SUITE=stretched EXTRA_VARS="$IMG"     # stretched VM/BM
```

The image overrides are required for `vmaas` and `full` (the guard in
`check_images.yml`); pass them for `bmaas` too, since the PR branch needs its
own images. `DEPLOY_SUITE=bmaas` runs the slow cross-tenant class unless
`TEST='not TestCrossTenantBmaasNetworking'` is added, as CI does. Every OSAC
install is fresh.

To run backend targets directly, change to `infra/netris/`. The `deploy` target
runs only `deploy-infra` → `deploy-ocp` → `deploy-osac`; it does not prepare a
test suite or run pytest.

## How target arguments work

- `KEY=value` after `make` sets a Make variable. Setting `KEY=value` in the
  shell environment also supplies a Make variable unless the Makefile overrides
  it. The backend Makefile decides whether and how to translate that value.
- `EXTRA_VARS='key=value other_key=value'` or
  `EXTRA_VARS='{"key": "value"}'` passes Ansible extra variables to the
  target's playbook. Only variables read by that playbook and its roles affect
  the target. On the composite `deploy` target, the same `EXTRA_VARS` is passed
  to all three deployment steps.
- The backend adds deployment context and path mappings to Ansible-backed
  targets. OCP targets additionally receive the underlay setting for
  `DEPLOY_SUITE=vmaas` and `DEPLOY_SUITE=full`.
- The backend's inventory defaults are in
  [`inventory/group_vars/all.yml`](inventory/group_vars/all.yml). `EXTRA_VARS`
  can override those defaults for a target that consumes them. Values defined
  by the backend as part of its contract are supplied after `EXTRA_VARS`; use
  their public Make variable instead of colliding with the generated Ansible
  variable.

## Input channels, mappings, and precedence

The channel describes who consumes a value; it is not a naming convention.
For example, a GitHub Actions step may put `EXTRA_VARS` in `env:` so the shell
can read it, then pass it to Make. In the Netris Makefile, that payload becomes
Ansible `-e` arguments. The GitHub step environment itself does not make those
keys Ansible variables or test-process environment variables.

| Channel | Consumer | Use it for | Netris examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shell/process environment | A workflow step, local script, or an explicit Ansible `lookup('env', ...)` | Credentials and settings that the process or a lookup reads | `NETRIS_PASSWORD`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `PULL_SECRET` for `deploy-jump` |
| Make variables | Root/backend Makefiles and commands they launch | Scenario selection and paths that the backend maps to its consumers | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `KUBECONFIG`, `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH` |
| `EXTRA_VARS` | Ansible playbooks as `-e` variables | Playbook/role configuration overrides | `dns_server`, `osac_branch`, image overrides |
| `.env.infra` | Root `run-tests`, then the OSAC test process | The test runtime connection contract | `KUBECONFIG`, `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `OSAC_VM_KUBECONFIG`, `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH` |

Ansible's task-level `environment:` setting exports a variable to the command
or module process for that task; it does not declare an Ansible variable. The
backend maps `KUBECONFIG` to the Ansible variable `kubeconfig_path`, and tasks
that run `oc`/`kubectl` set their process environment from that value. Ansible
does not automatically turn every shell environment variable into a playbook
variable; inventory values only read environment variables where they
explicitly use `lookup('env', ...)`.

| Public input | Backend mapping | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| `DEPLOY_SUITE` | Ansible `deploy_suite`; derives `OSAC_PROFILE` / Ansible `osac_profile`, `osac_values_file` and `bare_metal_services` | Deployment playbooks, OSAC installer, and setup dispatch |
| `BARE_METAL_SERVICES` | Ansible `bare_metal_services` | Derived: true for `caas`, `maas`, `bmaas` and `full`, false for `vmaas` |
| `TEST_SUITE` | No Ansible mapping | Root Make test-target selection only |
| `OSAC_NAMESPACE` | Ansible `osac_namespace` | Deployment/setup tasks and `.env.infra` |
| `KUBECONFIG` | Ansible `kubeconfig_path` | All Netris Ansible targets, installer commands, health check, and `.env.infra`; task commands receive it as `KUBECONFIG` |
| `OSAC_VM_KUBECONFIG` | No Ansible mapping | `.env.infra` only; selects the workload-cluster kubeconfig for tests |
| `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH` | Ansible `pull_secret_path` | Deployment roles and `.env.infra`; `deploy-jump` copies the local source file here on the remote host |
| `EXTRA_VARS` | Ansible `-e` payload | Target-specific role variables; it is not passed to pytest as environment |

Precedence is deliberate:

1. For inventory settings that use the `config` INI lookup, a non-empty
   `[default]` value wins over its environment fallback. A literal inventory
   default is used only where that variable defines one.
2. `EXTRA_VARS` becomes Ansible `-e`; Ansible gives extra variables higher
   precedence than inventory values and variables resolved from inventory
   lookups. See [Ansible variable precedence](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html).
3. The Netris Makefile appends its deployment selectors and canonical path
   mappings after user `EXTRA_VARS`. These backend-owned names therefore come
   from their public Make inputs. For example, set `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH`, not
   `pull_secret_path` in `EXTRA_VARS`. `bare_metal_services` is on the same
   list: setting it in `EXTRA_VARS` has no effect; use the Make variable
   `BARE_METAL_SERVICES`.
4. The `CAAS_*` and `MAAS_*` Ansible values come before `EXTRA_VARS`, so
   `EXTRA_VARS` wins over them. Use the `CAAS_*` and `MAAS_*` Make variables for
   the normal interface and `EXTRA_VARS` for deliberate low-level overrides.

Keep credentials in the ignored `config` file or the supported environment
fallbacks, not in `EXTRA_VARS`: Ansible extra variables are command-line
arguments and may appear in process listings or logs. `PULL_SECRET` has a
different meaning from `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH`: it is the local source file
used by `deploy-jump`; the latter is the remote destination and the path
exported to tests.

Examples:

```bash
# Ansible role options
make e2e INFRA=netris DEPLOY_SUITE=full TEST_SUITE=stretched \
  EXTRA_VARS="$IMG dns_server=<reachable-dns-server>"

# One canonical path used by Ansible, the remote bootstrap, and test runtime
OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH=/root/osac-pull-secret make e2e INFRA=netris DEPLOY_SUITE=full EXTRA_VARS="$IMG"
```

## Deployment and test suites

`DEPLOY_SUITE` selects what is deployed: the OSAC profile, the Netris overlay
that profile layers, the setup target and the EVPN underlay. `TEST_SUITE`
selects the OSAC tests and defaults to `DEPLOY_SUITE`. Test code lives in the
OSAC mono-repo and is selected by directory, never by markers.

| `DEPLOY_SUITE` | Base profile and Netris overlay | k8s manager | EVPN underlay | `BARE_METAL_SERVICES` | Setup target | Default `TEST_SUITE` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `caas` (default) | `caas-ci`, no overlay | `cudn_evpn` (profile) | no | true | `setup-caas` | `caas` |
| `maas` | `caas-ci`, no overlay | `cudn_evpn` (profile) | no | true | `setup-maas` | `maas` |
| `bmaas` | `bmaas-ci` + `values/bmaas-ci/netris.yaml` | none (`""`) | no | true | `setup-bmaas` | `bmaas` |
| `vmaas` | `vmaas-ci` + `values/vmaas-ci/netris.yaml` | `cudn_evpn` | yes | false | `setup-vmaas` | `vmaas` |
| `full` | `full-ci` + `values/full-ci/netris.yaml` | `cudn_evpn` | yes | true | `setup-full` | `full` |

`setup-full` runs `setup-caas`, `setup-bmaas` and `setup-vmaas`. The overlay
paths are in the OSAC checkout under `osac-installer/`. Agentless-Net
(`infra/agentless-net`) supports only `caas`; it is a standalone CaaS flow that
the root `make e2e` does not wire up.

| `TEST_SUITE` | Selects | Valid on |
|---|---|---|
| `vmaas` | `tests/e2e/networking/vmaas/test_vmaas_networking.py`, then its billing files | `vmaas` |
| `bmaas` | `tests/e2e/networking/bmaas/` | `bmaas` only: its `PROTOCOL_ICMP` rules are rejected with cudn_evpn |
| `stretched` | `tests/e2e/networking/stretched/` | `full` |
| `full` | `tests/e2e/` minus `networking/vmaas` and `networking/bmaas`, serial | `full` |
| `caas` | `tests/e2e/caas/` | `caas`, `full` |

`maas`, `caas_networking`, `maas_networking`, `storage`, `metering` and
`references` also exist as `test-<suite>` targets. `tests/e2e/networking/vmaas/`
holds one ordered module whose tests depend on each other: `test-vmaas` runs
`test_vmaas_networking.py` (`test_00` to `test_14`) with `-x` (stops at the first failure; the
fixture finalizers clean up) and `TEST=` (`-k`) must never slice it. A second
pytest run, also with `-x`, then runs `test_external_ip_billing.py`,
`test_external_ip_reattach_billing.py` and `test_nat_gateway_billing.py`. It
starts even when the module failed, and a failure of either run fails the
target. A listed file that the osac checkout does not have is skipped, so the
target merges in either order with osac. The billing files skip when no
metering echo adapter is found. Every kept test decides the job.

The PR E2E commands use the same split:

| PR command | `DEPLOY_SUITE` | `TEST_SUITE` | OSAC profile | Check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/test vmaas-netris` | `vmaas` | `vmaas` | `vmaas-ci` | `E2E / VMaaS Netris Full Install` |
| `/test bmaas-netris` | `bmaas` | `bmaas` | `bmaas-ci` | `E2E / BMaaS Netris Full Install` |
| `/test stretched-netris` | `full` | `stretched` | `full-ci` | `E2E / Stretched Netris Full Install` |

## Make variables

| Variable | Default | Targets and meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `INFRA` | none | Required at the root; no default. Selects the backend under `infra/`. |
| `DEPLOY_SUITE` | `caas` (backend default) | `deploy`, `deploy-infra`, `deploy-ocp`, `deploy-osac`, and suite targets. Supported scenarios are `caas`, `maas`, `bmaas`, `vmaas`, and `full`; selects setup behavior and derives the OSAC profile. |
| `TEST_SUITE` | `$(DEPLOY_SUITE)` | Root orchestration only: selects the contract file and the `test-<suite>` target. |
| `TEST` | none | pytest `-k` filter for `test-<suite>`; never with `test-vmaas`, an ordered module. |
| `EXTRA_VARS` | empty | Ansible-backed targets and the `deploy`/redeploy composites. Passes Ansible variables to the playbook(s) used by the target. |
| `SUITE_STAGE` | `all` | `deploy-suite` stage: `all`, `setup` or `workload`. |
| `OSAC_NAMESPACE` | `osac-e2e-ci` | `deploy-osac`, `destroy-osac`, and the `.env.infra` connection settings. Passed to Ansible and the OSAC installer. |
| `KUBECONFIG` | `/root/.kube/config` | Mapped to Ansible `kubeconfig_path` for every Netris Ansible target, passed to installer and health-check commands, and written to `.env.infra`. |
| `OSAC_VM_KUBECONFIG` | same as `KUBECONFIG` | Written to `.env.infra` for VMaaS/full deployments; for the other scenarios, the backend records the hub kubeconfig as the VM kubeconfig. |
| `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH` | `/root/pull-secret` | Remote pull-secret path used by deployment roles and written to `.env.infra`; `deploy-jump` copies the local source file to this path. |
| `OSAC_PROFILE` | derived | Not an override. The backend derives `caas-ci`, `vmaas-ci`, `bmaas-ci`, or `full-ci` from `DEPLOY_SUITE` and rejects a command-line override. |
| `OSAC_MONO_DIR` | `/opt/osac` | Root `test-<suite>` targets: the OSAC mono-repo checkout that pytest runs in. |
| `BARE_METAL_SERVICES` | derived | Ansible `bare_metal_services`: true for `caas`, `maas`, `bmaas` and `full`, false for `vmaas`. |
| `OSAC_TEST_TENANT_NAME` | `tenant1` | Tenant that the CaaS, MaaS and BMaaS setup and deploy targets use. |
| `CAAS_*`, `MAAS_*` | see below | CaaS and MaaS worker, image and template settings. |

The CaaS variables:

| Variable | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `CAAS_BAREMETAL_INSTANCE_TYPE` | `ci-worker` | `setup-caas`, `deploy-caas` |
| `CAAS_DISK_IMAGE_NAME` | `rhcos-4-22-amd64` | `setup-caas`, `deploy-caas`; MaaS default |
| `CAAS_DISK_IMAGE_SOURCE_REF` | `oci://quay.io/osac-project/rhcos:4.22.0` | `setup-caas`; MaaS default |
| `CAAS_WORKER_COUNT` | `1` | `setup-caas`, `deploy-caas` |
| `CAAS_WORKER_VCPU` | `4` | `setup-caas` |
| `CAAS_WORKER_MEMORY_MB` | `16384` | `setup-caas` |

The MaaS wrappers have additional Make variables:

| Variable | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `MAAS_CLUSTER_NAME` | `maas-cluster` | `setup-maas`, `deploy-maas`, and destroy wrappers |
| `MAAS_BAREMETAL_INSTANCE_TYPE` | `g5` | MaaS setup/deploy/destroy wrappers |
| `MAAS_WORKER_COUNT` | `2` | MaaS setup/deploy/destroy wrappers |
| `MAAS_CLUSTER_TEMPLATE` | `osac.templates.ocp_4_20_ai_maas` | MaaS setup/deploy/destroy wrappers |
| `MAAS_CATALOG_ITEM` | `maas-ocp` | MaaS setup/deploy/destroy wrappers |
| `MAAS_DISK_IMAGE_NAME` | `$(CAAS_DISK_IMAGE_NAME)` | MaaS setup/deploy/destroy wrappers |
| `MAAS_DISK_IMAGE_SOURCE_REF` | `$(CAAS_DISK_IMAGE_SOURCE_REF)` | `setup-maas` |
| `MAAS_WORKER_VCPU` | `10` | MaaS setup/deploy/destroy wrappers |
| `MAAS_WORKER_MEMORY_MB` | `20480` | MaaS setup/deploy/destroy wrappers |

`setup-maas` and `deploy-maas` are backend wrappers over the CaaS playbooks;
`maas` is a supported `DEPLOY_SUITE`.

## Environment, config file, and local files

Ansible reads `infra/netris/config` as an INI file. For these values, a
non-empty `[default]` entry in the config file takes precedence; the listed
environment variable is the fallback.

| Config key | Environment fallback | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `netris_password` | `NETRIS_PASSWORD` | Netris API operations, including OCP and BMaaS setup |
| `quay_username` | `QUAY_USERNAME` | `setup-infra`, when caching the OCP SNO image |
| `quay_password` | `QUAY_PASSWORD` | `setup-infra`, when caching the OCP SNO image |
| `lab_name` | `LAB_NAME` | Lab DNS name; defaults to `default` |
| `dns_hosted_zone` | `DNS_HOSTED_ZONE` | Route 53 zone; defaults to `ecoeng-osac-ci.devcluster.openshift.com` |
| `aws_access_key_id` | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Route 53 record management |
| `aws_secret_access_key` | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Route 53 record management |
| `aws_region` | `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | Route 53 record management; defaults to `us-east-1` |

The backend also expects these local files at their configured/default paths:

| File | Default path | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Netris license | `infra/netris/license.key` | Lab setup |
| OSAC/AAP license | `infra/netris/license.zip` | OSAC install |
| OpenShift pull secret | `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH` (default `/root/pull-secret`) | OCP restore, OSAC install, and tests that mount this path |
| SSH public key | `/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` | OCP restore |

`config_path` can also be overridden as an Ansible variable. `netris_password`,
`quay_username`, and `quay_password` should use the config file or their
documented environment fallback rather than `EXTRA_VARS`. `pull_secret_path`
is the internal Ansible name mapped from `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH`; set the
public Make variable instead. `ssh_public_key_path` remains an Ansible
variable.

The shell-script targets have additional environment inputs:

| Variable | Default | Target | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SERVER` | none | `deploy-jump` | Required remote server IP/hostname. |
| `LAB_NAME` | none in `deploy-jump` | `deploy-jump`; backend config fallback | Required by `deploy-jump`; selects the per-lab DNS prefix. |
| `PULL_SECRET` | none | `deploy-jump` | Required local path to the OpenShift pull-secret file; copied to the remote `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH`. |
| `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH` | `/root/pull-secret` | `deploy-jump` | Remote path for the copied pull secret; the same value is passed to the server-side Make deployment and exported for tests. |
| `NETRIS_PASSWORD` | none | `deploy-jump` | Required; written to the remote `config` file over SSH, not placed in the SSH command. |
| `QUAY_USERNAME`, `QUAY_PASSWORD` | empty | `deploy-jump` | Set both or neither; written to the remote `config` for private snapshot flavor pulls. |
| `LICENSE_KEY` | none | `deploy-jump` | Required local path to the Netris license key. |
| `LICENSE_ZIP` | none | `deploy-jump` | Required local path to the OSAC/AAP license archive. |
| `PASSWORD` | empty | `deploy-jump` | Optional SSH password; SSH key authentication is used when empty. |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | empty | `deploy-jump` | Optional Route 53 credentials. If both are set, the remote config uses Route 53; otherwise it uses local DNS mode. |
| `DEPLOY_TARGET` | `redeploy-fresh` | `deploy-jump` | Remote Make command started in tmux; may include Make assignments, for example `redeploy-fresh DEPLOY_SUITE=maas`. |
| `CACHE_DIR` | `$HOME/.cache/netris-lab/k3s-images` | `deploy-jump` / `cache-images.sh` | Local cache directory for Netris lab container images. |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | `10` | `cache-images.sh` (called by `deploy-jump`) | Maximum image download attempts. |
| `BASE_DELAY` | `30` seconds | `cache-images.sh` (called by `deploy-jump`) | Initial retry delay. |
| `MAX_DELAY` | `300` seconds | `cache-images.sh` (called by `deploy-jump`) | Maximum retry delay. |
| `DEPLOY_PROGRESS_FILE` | `/root/.deploy-progress` | `redeploy-fresh`, `redeploy-continue` | Progress file used to resume the server-side redeploy sequence. |
| `OSAC_NAMESPACE` | `osac-devel` | `health-check` | Namespace checked by the health script; this default is independent of the Makefile default. |
| `KUBECONFIG` | `/root/.kube/config` | `health-check` | Kubeconfig used by the health script. |
| `OCP_VM_PATTERN` | `hgx-pod00-su0-h00` | `health-check` | VM name pattern checked by the health script. |
| `INGRESS_FORWARD_PORT` | `9444` | `health-check`, `ingress-forward` | Lab host port that forwards to the OCP ingress; reachable from pods and browsers. |
| `LAB_HOST_IP` | first address of `hostname -I` | `health-check` | Lab host address the health script uses to reach the forwarded routes. |

## Target-by-target inputs

Unless a row says otherwise, an Ansible-backed target accepts `EXTRA_VARS` and
the inventory variables listed for its target family in the next section.
The playbook shown is the direct backend Makefile entry point.

| Target | Playbook or action | Inputs used by this target |
|---|---|---|
| `deploy` | Composite: `deploy-infra`, `deploy-ocp`, `deploy-osac` | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `EXTRA_VARS`; same extra vars reach each phase. |
| `deploy-setup` / `setup-infra` | `playbooks/deploy-setup.yml` | `EXTRA_VARS`; `disk_setup_enabled` opts into automatic data-disk setup. Snapshot registry credentials are read from config/environment while caching the OCP image. |
| `deploy-infra` | `playbooks/deploy-infra.yml` | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `EXTRA_VARS`; `vmaas` and `full` automatically enable the OCP underlay. Uses the infrastructure/network variables below and variables from the Netris lab submodule. |
| `deploy-ocp` | `playbooks/deploy-ocp.yml` | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `KUBECONFIG`, `EXTRA_VARS`; `vmaas` and `full` automatically enable the underlay/EVPN setup. Uses OCP, DNS, Netris, and snapshot-restore variables below. |
| `deploy-osac` | `install-osac`; writes `.env.infra` after a successful install | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `KUBECONFIG`, `OSAC_VM_KUBECONFIG`, `OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH`, `EXTRA_VARS`; installs the profile derived from `DEPLOY_SUITE`. |
| `install-osac` | Composite: `prep-osac`, `run-osac-setup`, then `ingress-forward` | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `KUBECONFIG`, `EXTRA_VARS`; requires OCP to have been restored by `deploy-ocp`. |
| `ingress-forward` | `playbooks/ingress-forward.yml` | `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `KUBECONFIG`, `EXTRA_VARS`; points Keycloak and every issuer consumer at the forwarded ingress port, adds the Keycloak host alias to the OSAC workloads, and allows the forwarded callback on the `osac-ui` client. Idempotent; also runs inside `post-install`. |
| `prep-osac` | `playbooks/prep-osac.yml` | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `KUBECONFIG`, `EXTRA_VARS`; prepares OSAC and generates `values/<profile>/netris-runtime.yaml`. |
| `run-osac-setup` | OSAC installer (`install-infra`, then `install-osac`) | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `KUBECONFIG`; consumes the OCP EVPN values from `deploy-ocp`, the profile's `netris.yaml`, and the runtime values. |
| `setup-vmaas` | `playbooks/setup-vmaas.yml` | `KUBECONFIG`, `EXTRA_VARS`; uses the EVPN validation and VMaaS return-path variables below. |
| `gather-vmaas` | `playbooks/gather-vmaas.yml` | `KUBECONFIG`, `OSAC_VM_KUBECONFIG`, `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `EXTRA_VARS`; read-only (`oc get`, `oc logs`): writes `mgmt-cluster/vmaas/` (hub CRs, workload VMs and VMIs reduced to an allow-list without cloud-init data, UDN/NADs, SSH helper Pods, OSAC operator logs). The workflow runs `gather-infra` separately; `gather-full` runs both. |
| `destroy-vmaas` | Makefile only | `KUBECONFIG` (hub). VMaaS setup creates no tenant resources, but the target deletes the helper Pods, Secrets and NetworkPolicies labeled `osac-e2e/ssh-helper=true` in every namespace (`kubectl delete -A`; nothing found is fine). Cluster prerequisites are removed by `destroy-ocp`. |
| `setup-caas` | `playbooks/setup-caas.yml` | `CAAS_*`, `OSAC_TEST_TENANT_NAME`, `EXTRA_VARS`; prepares BMaaS worker VMs, registers worker types, the DiskImage, the Netris ExternalIPPool, and the catalog. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `deploy-caas` | `playbooks/deploy-caas.yml` | `CAAS_*`, `OSAC_TEST_TENANT_NAME`, `EXTRA_VARS`; creates the CaaS catalog cluster with one `ci-worker` BareMetalInstanceType. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `setup-bmc` | `playbooks/setup-bmc.yml` | `EXTRA_VARS`; uses `bare_metal_services`, `bmc_net_*`, and `sushy_tools_*`. |
| `setup-bmaas` | `playbooks/setup-bmaas.yml` | `DEPLOY_SUITE=bmaas`, `EXTRA_VARS`; uses BMC, BMaaS, and BM provisioning-network variables. Appends the BMaaS keys to `.env.infra`. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `deploy-bmaas` | `playbooks/deploy-bmaas.yml` | `EXTRA_VARS`; creates one persistent BareMetalInstance in each test tenant. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `setup-full` | Calls `setup-caas`, `setup-bmaas`, then `setup-vmaas` | `DEPLOY_SUITE=full`, `EXTRA_VARS`; prepares the CaaS, BMaaS and VMaaS prerequisites. |
| `setup-maas` | `playbooks/setup-caas.yml` with `MAAS_EXTRA` | `MAAS_*`, `OSAC_TEST_TENANT_NAME`, `EXTRA_VARS`; configures all three BMaaS worker VMs as 10 vCPU / 20GiB `g5` hosts. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `deploy-maas` | `playbooks/deploy-caas.yml` with `MAAS_EXTRA` | `MAAS_*`, `OSAC_TEST_TENANT_NAME`, `EXTRA_VARS`; creates the MaaS catalog cluster with two `g5` BareMetalInstanceTypes. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `destroy-maas` / `force-destroy-maas` | CaaS destroy playbooks with `MAAS_EXTRA` | MaaS Make variables above plus `EXTRA_VARS`. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `destroy-suite` | Backend target; runs `destroy-<DEPLOY_SUITE>` | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `EXTRA_VARS`; the backend rejects `full` because that scenario shares the whole lab. |
| `destroy-osac` | OSAC installer uninstall | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `KUBECONFIG`; removes `.env.infra`. |
| `destroy-ocp` | `playbooks/destroy-ocp.yml` | `KUBECONFIG`, `EXTRA_VARS`; resets OCP for reinstall. It removes the default kubeconfig only when `KUBECONFIG` is `/root/.kube/config`, preserving a custom path supplied by the caller. |
| `destroy-infra` / `destroy-setup` | `playbooks/destroy-infra.yml` / `destroy-setup.yml` | `EXTRA_VARS`; teardown variables from the matching playbook/role. |
| `destroy-caas` / `force-destroy-caas` | CaaS destroy playbooks | `OSAC_TEST_TENANT_NAME`, `EXTRA_VARS`; `destroy-caas` deletes the named OSAC cluster and retains reusable BMaaS hosts, `force-destroy-caas` force-cleans stuck orders, removes worker BMHs, wipes worker VMs, and sweeps Netris orphans. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `destroy-bmaas` | `playbooks/destroy-bmaas.yml` | `EXTRA_VARS`; uses BMaaS and BMC variables. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `prepare-suite` | Runs `setup-<DEPLOY_SUITE>` | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `EXTRA_VARS`; the suite preparation that `make e2e` runs before pytest. Tenants are created by the pytest fixtures. |
| `deploy-suite` | `prepare-suite`, then the persistent deploy playbook | `DEPLOY_SUITE` (`caas`, `maas` or `bmaas`), `SUITE_STAGE`, `EXTRA_VARS`; prepares pytest tenants, Netris tenant networking and the persistent workloads on an installed lab. Unrelated to the `DEPLOY_SUITE` variable. |
| `test-caas-networking`, `test-maas-networking` | Root `run-tests` with `TEST_SUITE=caas_networking` or `maas_networking` | Run dedicated OSAC suites when the OSAC path exists; fail otherwise. |
| `gather-infra` | `playbooks/gather-infra.yml` | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `KUBECONFIG`, `EXTRA_VARS`; collects backend and cluster diagnostics. |
| `gather-mgmt-cluster` / `gather-caas` / `gather-bmaas` | Corresponding gather playbook | `EXTRA_VARS`; uses the matching cluster/service variables. These commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `gather-full` | Calls `gather-caas`, `gather-bmaas`, `gather-infra` | `EXTRA_VARS`; collects the full deployment's diagnostics. |
| `connectivity` | `playbooks/connectivity.yml` | `EXTRA_VARS`; uses connectivity and Netris lab variables. |
| `disk-setup` | `playbooks/disk-setup.yml` | `EXTRA_VARS`; use `disk_setup_enabled` with `setup-infra` to make this step automatic. |
| `cleanup-dns` | `playbooks/cleanup-dns.yml` | `EXTRA_VARS`; uses `lab_name`, DNS zone, OCP identity, and AWS credentials. |
| `destroy-full` | `playbooks/destroy-full.yml` | `EXTRA_VARS`; uses lab, DNS, and AWS settings. This tears down the complete lab. |
| `access-doc` / `post-install` | Access-document playbook | `EXTRA_VARS`; uses OCP identity and OSAC namespace. `post-install` publishes the forwarded endpoints (see `ingress-forward`) and generates the access document. Task commands use `kubeconfig_path` (default `/root/.kube/config`). |
| `redeploy-fresh` / `redeploy-continue` | `scripts/redeploy-server.sh` | `DEPLOY_SUITE`, `EXTRA_VARS`; the script supports the `caas`, `maas`, and `bmaas` flows. `redeploy-fresh` destroys the lab and starts over; `redeploy-continue` resumes. |
| `deploy-jump` | `scripts/deploy-jump.sh` | Requires the settings shown in [`scripts/env.sh.example`](scripts/env.sh.example); see the remote deployment section in the README. |
| `vendor-update`, `lint`, `health-check` | Local command/script | No Ansible `EXTRA_VARS` inputs. |

The Makefile passes `EXTRA_VARS` to `deploy-infra`, and that playbook includes
the Netris lab submodule's roles. Options defined by that submodule are also
available there; see
[`netris-lab/group_vars/all.yml`](netris-lab/group_vars/all.yml) for its
defaults. They are separate from the backend variables listed below.

## Ansible `EXTRA_VARS` catalog

Every key of [`inventory/group_vars/all.yml`](inventory/group_vars/all.yml)
is listed below with its default and the roles, playbooks or scripts that read
it. Pass an override with `EXTRA_VARS` on a target that consumes the key.
Defaults and comments in that file are authoritative. CI fails when this
catalog and `all.yml` list different keys.

`disk_setup_enabled` is an opt-in role variable used by `setup-infra`; it is
not a key in `group_vars/all.yml`. `EXTRA_VARS` may also contain variables
defined by an included role or the Netris lab submodule. Those variables are
target-specific and should be checked at the referenced playbook/role.

## Lab facts

Tenant CIDRs: prep-osac always adds all of `10.0.0.0/8` (the lab's Netris private allocation, `netris_private_allocation_cidr`) to `global.networking.excludedIpv4Cidrs` and asserts that the default tenant network and subnet are outside it. The lab sets no 10.x tenant network; the E2E suites use 172.16-172.31 except 172.27 (ExternalIP test pools) and 172.30 (OpenShift services). Keep any you add inside that set.

The VMaaS and stretched tests reach guests through a helper Pod, not `virtctl`. The pytest host needs `kubectl` or `oc`, `ssh` and `ssh-keygen`; the cluster must be able to pull `OSAC_E2E_SSH_HELPER_IMAGE` (default: the digest-pinned `ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-aap` image the cluster already pulls for AAP jobs; the lab exports nothing, set it to the deployed tag or a mirror only when ghcr.io is unreachable).

`prep-osac` patches the cloned aap chart (`osac-aap/charts/aap/templates/config-as-code-secret.yaml`) to accept the lab's plain-HTTP Netris controller URL. There are no DNS settings: VMs use the cluster DNS that OVN-K DHCP gives, and bare metal uses the Netris default DHCP option set.

`deploy-osac` writes `infra/netris/.env.infra` with `KUBECONFIG`, `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `OSAC_VM_KUBECONFIG` and
`OSAC_PULL_SECRET_PATH`. `setup-bmaas` appends the BMaaS keys (`OSAC_BMH_SSH_HOSTS`, `OSAC_BMI_INSTANCE_TYPE`,
`OSAC_BMI_NETWORK_INTERFACE`) that the contracts in `infra/netris/contracts/<test-suite>` require (`bmaas`,
`stretched`, `full`; `vmaas` needs only `KUBECONFIG`, `OSAC_NAMESPACE`, `OSAC_VM_KUBECONFIG`). `setup-vmaas` adds `OSAC_NETRIS_VM_EXTERNAL_PATH_ENABLED=true` only when the `172.27.0.0/16`
return path is acknowledged; only older osac checkouts read it.

## Old names

| `SUITE=vmaas` (generic tree) | `DEPLOY_SUITE=full` |
| `OSAC_PROFILE=cudn-evpn-netris-test` | removed; `DEPLOY_SUITE=vmaas` derives `vmaas-ci` and its `netris.yaml` |
| `netris-private.local.yaml` | `netris-runtime.yaml` |
| `OSAC_DEPLOY_MODE=fresh` | removed (every install is fresh) |
| `OSAC_DEPLOY_MODE=snapshot`, `make deploy-fast` | removed; the OCP SNO snapshot restore stays |

`make` stops with an error when `SUITE` or `OSAC_DEPLOY_MODE` is set, at the root and in `infra/netris`.
